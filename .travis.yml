# command to install dependencies
# Ideally we would be pip installing tk-core, but we need the testing framework from core,
# so we will clone the repo install to a known location and run the tests there.
install:
    - git clone https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-core /tmp/tk-core
    - pushd /tmp/tk-core
    - git checkout master
    - popd
    # install pyside - from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24489588
    - sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
    - pip install PySide --no-index --find-links https://parkin.github.io/python-wheelhouse/;
    # Travis CI servers use virtualenvs, so we need to finish the install by the following
    - python ~/virtualenv/python${TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION}/bin/pyside_postinstall.py -install
    - pip install coverage
    - pip install coveralls

# command to run tests
script: /tmp/tk-core/tests/run_tests.sh --test-root tests --with-coverage
