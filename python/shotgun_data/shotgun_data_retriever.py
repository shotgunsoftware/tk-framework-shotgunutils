        Convenience and compatibility method for quick and easy synchrnous thumbnail download.

        a path to it will be returned instantly. If not, it will be downloaded from Shotgun,
        placed in the standard cache location on disk and its path will be returned.

        This is a helper method meant to make it easy to port over synchronous legacy
        code - for a better solution, we recommend using the thumbnail retrieval
        that runs in a background thread.

        Bcause Shotgun thumbnail urls have an expiry time, make sure to only
        pass urls to this method that have been very recently retrieved via a Shotgun find call.
