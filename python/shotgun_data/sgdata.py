    Asynchronous data retrieve class which can be used to retrieve data
    and thumbnails from Shotgun and from disk thumbnail cache.

    The class manages a queue where you can add various requests.
    Requests are queued up using the execute_find() and request_thumbnail() methods.

    Requests are executed in the following priority order:

    - first any thumbnails that are already cached on disk are handled
    - next, shotgun find() queries are handled
    - lastly thumbnail downloads are handled

    The thread will emit work_completed and work_failure signals
    when tasks are completed (or fail).

    The clear() method will clear the current queue. The currently
    processing item will finish processing and may send out signals
    even after a clear.

    Make sure you call the stop() method prior to destruction in order
    for the system to gracefully shut down.

        placed in the standard cache location on disk and its path will be returned.
