    """
    Asynchronous data retriever class which can be used to retrieve data and 
    thumbnails from Shotgun and from disk thumbnail cache. The class manages 
    a queue where you can add various requests. Requests are queued up using 
    for example the :meth:`execute_find()` and :meth:`request_thumbnail()` 
    methods.

    Requests are executed in the following priority order:

    - First any thumbnails that are already cached on disk are handled.
    - Next, shotgun find() queries are handled.
    - Lastly thumbnail downloads are handled.
    
    The thread will emit work_completed and work_failure signals when 
    tasks are completed (or fail). The :meth:`clear()` method will 
    clear the current queue. The currently processing item will finish 
    processing and may send out signals even after a clear. Make sure you 
    call the :meth:`stop()` method prior to destruction in order for the 
    system to gracefully shut down.

        a requested task has completed. ``uid`` is a unique id which matches 
        the unique id returned by the corresponding request call. 
        ``request_type`` is a string denoting the type of request this 
        event is associated with. ``data_dict`` is a dictionary containing 
        the payload of the request. It will be different depending on what 
        type of request it is. 
    
    :signal work_failure(uid, error_message): Emitted every time a requested 
        task has failed. ``uid`` is a unique id which matches the unique 
        id returned by the corresponding request call.
