class QtTaskRunner(qt_importer.QtCore.QObject):
    """
    Wrapper class for a callback payload.

    This is used in conjunction with a QT event loop, allowing a
    given callback to be run inside an event loop. By the end of
    the execution, if the callback payload has not created any
    windows, a ``completed`` signal is emitted. This allows for
    a pattern where the QT event loop can be explicitly torn down
    for callback payloads which don't start up new dialogs.

    In the case of dialogs, QT defaults to a "terminate event loop
    when the last window closes", ensuring a graceful termination
    when the dialog is closed.

    Typically used like this::

        task_runner = QtTaskRunner(callback_payload)

        # start up our QApplication
        qt_application = qt_importer.QtGui.QApplication([])

        # Set up automatic execution of our task runner as soon
        # as the event loop starts up.
        qt_importer.QtCore.QTimer.singleShot(0, task_runner.execute_command)

        # and ask the main app to exit when the task emits its finished signal
        task_runner.completed.connect(qt_application.quit)

        # start the application loop. This will block the process until the task
        # has completed - this is either triggered by a main window closing or
        # byt the finished signal being called from the task class above.
        qt_application.exec_()

        # check if any errors were raised.
