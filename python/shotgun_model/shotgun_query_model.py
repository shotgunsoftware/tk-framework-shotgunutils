class ShotgunQueryModel(QtGui.QStandardItemModel):
    """
    A Qt Model base class for querying Shotgun data.

    This class is not meant to be used as-is, rather it provides a common
    interface (methods, signals, etc) for developers to provide across various
    Shotgun data query models.

    Some convenience methods are also provided for handling and manipulating
    data returned from Shotgun.

    Signal Interface
    ----------------

    :signal query_changed(): Gets emitted whenever the model's sg query is
        changed. When the query changes, the contents of the model is cleared
        and the loading of new data is initiated.

    :signal cache_loaded(): Emitted whenever the model loads cache data.
        This typically follows shortly after a query changed signal, if
        cache data is available.

    :signal data_refreshing(): Emitted whenever the model starts to refresh its
        shotgun data. Useful signal if you want to present a loading indicator
        of some kind.

    :signal data_refreshed(bool): Emitted whenever the model has been updated
        with fresh shotgun data. The boolean indicates that a change in the
        model data has taken place as part of this process. If the refresh fails
        for some reason, this signal may not be emitted.

    :signal data_refresh_fail(str): Emitted in the case the refresh fails for
        some reason, typically due to the absence of an internet connection.
        This signal could for example be used to drive a "retry" button of some
        kind. The str parameter carries an error message with details about why
        the refresh wasn't successful.

    Constants
    ---------

    :constant SG_DATA_ROLE: Custom model role that holds the shotgun data
        payload

    :constant IS_SG_MODEL_ROLE: Used to identify model items related to Shotgun
        data

        a default thumbnail.  In the current implementation, thumbnails are not
        cached in the same way as the rest of the model data, meaning that this
        method is executed each time an item is constructed, regardless of if
        it came from an asynchronous shotgun query or a cache fetch.

        The purpose of this method is that you can subclass it if you want to
        ensure that items have an associated thumbnail directly when they are
        first created.

        Later on in the data load cycle, if the model was instantiated with the
        `download_thumbs` parameter set to True, the standard Shotgun ``image``
        field thumbnail will be automatically downloaded for all items (or
        picked up from local cache if possible).

            added to the model.  This has been primed with the standard

        make other changes that may be useful. Nothing needs to be returned.

        This method is called before the item is added into the model tree. At
        the point when the item is added into the tree, various signals will
        fire, informing views and proxy models that a new item has been added.

        - :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QStandardItem` is created, either through a cache load from disk or
          from a payload coming from the Shotgun API.
        - After the item has been set up with its associated Shotgun data,
          :meth:`_populate_default_thumbnail()` is called, allowing client code to set
          up a default thumbnail that will be shown while potential real thumbnail
          data is being loaded.
        - The model will now start looking for the real thumbail.
        - If the thumbnail is already cached on disk, :meth:`_populate_thumbnail()` is called very soon.
        - If there isn't a thumbnail associated, :meth:`_populate_thumbnail()` will not be called.
        - If there isn't a thumbnail cached, the model will asynchronously download
          the thumbnail from Shotgun and then (after some time) call :meth:`_populate_thumbnail()`.

        instantiated with the download_thumbs flag set to be true. It will be called for

        leaf nodes). It will also be called once the data requested via _request_thumbnail_download()
        arrives.
