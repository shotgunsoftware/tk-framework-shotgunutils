class ShotgunOverlayModel(ShotgunModel):
    """
    Convenience wrapper around the :class:`ShotgunModel` class which adds spinner and 
    error reporting overlay functionality. Where the :class:`ShotgunModel` is a classic 
    model class which purely deals with data, this class connects with a :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QWidget` 
    in order to provide progress feedback whenever necessary. Internally, 
    it holds an instance of the :class:`~tk-framework-qtwidgets:overlay_widget.ShotgunOverlayWidget` widget (which is part of 
    the QtWidgets framework) and will show this whenever there is no data to 
    display in the view. This means that it is straight forward to create 
    shotgun views with a spinner on top indicating when data is being loaded 
    and where any errors are automatically reported to the user.
    
    :signal progress_spinner_start(): Signal that gets emitted whenever the 
        model deems it appropriate to indicate that data is being loaded. 
        Note that this signal is not emitted every time data is loaded from 
        Shotgun, but only when there is no cached data available to display. 
        This signal can be useful if an implementation wants to set up a custom 
        overlay system instead of or in addition to the built in one that is 
        provided via the :meth:`set_overlay_parent()` method.
    
    :signal progress_spinner_end(): Emitted every time a progress spinner 
        should be deactivated.
