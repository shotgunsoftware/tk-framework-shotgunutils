    """
    A Qt Model representing a Shotgun hierarchy.

    .. warning::

        Use of this model requires version Shotgun ``v7.0.2`` or later.
        Attempts to construct an instance of this model on an older version of
        Shotgun will result with a single item in the model saying that
        Hierarchy model isn't supported. A warning will also be logged.

    This class implements a standard :class:`~PySide.QtCore.QAbstractItemModel`
    specialized to hold the contents of a particular Shotgun query. It is cached
    and refreshes its data asynchronously.

    In order to use this class, you normally subclass it and implement certain
    key data methods for setting up queries, customizing etc. Then you connect
    your class to a :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QAbstractItemView` of some sort which
    will display the result.

    The model stores a single column, lazy-loaded Shotgun Hierarchy as queried
    via the :meth:`~shotgun-api3:shotgun_api3.Shotgun.nav_expand()`
    python-api method. The structure of items in the hierarchy mimics what is
    found in Shotgun as configured in each project's
    `Tracking Settings <https://help.autodesk.com/view/SGSUB/ENU/?guid=SG_Administrator_ar_display_options_ar_project_tracking_settings_html>`__.

        :meth:`ShotgunHierarchyModel.async_item_from_entity` or
        :meth:`ShotgunHierarchyModel.async_item_from_paths` has completed.

            If your shotgun model contains logic in subclassed methods that
            modify the shotgun data prior to it being put into the cache system
            that the ShotgunModel maintains, you can use this option to ensure
            that different versions of the code access different caches. If you
            change your custom business logic around and update the generation
            number, both new and old versions of the code will work correctly

            UX whereby a user can select an item representing the root without
            having a UI that shows a single, top-level item. An example would
            be displaying published file entity hierarchy with top level items:
            "Assets", "Shots", and "Project Publishes". In this example, the
            supplied arg would look like: ``include_root="Project Publishes"``.

        Any existing data contained in the model will be cleared.

        This method will not call the Shotgun API. If cached data is available,

            where the leaves match the entity value of Version entities.

        :param dict root: This is the entity that will be at the root

            projects can be set as the root of a hierarchy model.

        :param dict entity_fields: A dictionary that identifies what fields to
            include on returned entities. Since the hierarchy can include any
            entity structure, this argument allows for specification of
            additional fields to include as these entities are returned. The

        :param cache_seed:
            Advanced parameter. With each shotgun query being cached on disk,

            disk. Since the cache data on disk is a reflection of a particular
            hierarchy query, this seed is typically generated from the
            seed entity field and return entity fields supplied to this method.
            However, in cases where you are doing advanced subclassing, for
            example when you are culling out data based on some external state,
            the model state does not solely depend on the shotgun parameters. It
            may also depend on some external factors. In this case, the cache
            seed should also be influenced by those parameters and you can pass
