    A QT Model representing a Shotgun query.

    This class implements a standard  :class:`~PySide.QtCore.QAbstractItemModel` 
    specialized to hold the contents of a particular Shotgun query. It is cached 
    and refreshes its data asynchronously.

    In order to use this class, you normally subclass it and implement certain key data
    methods for setting up queries, customizing etc. Then you connect your class to
    a :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QAbstractItemView` of some sort which will display the result. If you need to do manipulations
    such as sorting or filtering on the data, connect a proxy model (typically :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QSortFilterProxyModel`) 
    between your class and the view.
    
    :signal query_changed(): Gets emitted whenever the model's sg query is changed.
        When the query changes, the contents of the model is cleared and the
        loading of new data is initiated.
        
    :signal cache_loaded(): Emitted whenever the model loads cache data.
        This typically follows shortly after a query changed signal, if
        cache data is available.
    
    :signal data_refreshing(): Emitted whenever the model starts to refresh its
        shotgun data. This is emitted from :meth:`_refresh_data()`.  Useful 
        signal if you want to present a loading indicator of some kind.
        
    :signal data_refreshed(bool): Emitted whenever the model has been updated with fresh
        shotgun data. The boolean indicates that a change in the model data has
        taken place as part of this process. If the refresh fails for some reason,
        this signal may not be emitted. The synchronous data refresh cycle starts 
        with a call to :meth:`_refresh_data()` and normally ends with either a 
        data_refreshed or a data_refresh_fail signal being emitted.
        
    :signal data_refresh_fail(): Emitted in the case the refresh fails for some reason,
        typically due to the absence of an internet connection. This signal could
        for example be used to drive a "retry" button of some kind. The str
        parameter carries an error message with details about why the
        refresh wasn't successful.

        associated value. See :ref:`sg-model-data-items`.

        """
        This is the main method to use to configure the model. You basically
        pass a specific find query to the model and it will start tracking
        this particular set of filter and hierarchy parameters.

        Any existing data in contained in the model will be cleared.

        This method will not call the Shotgun API. If cached data is available,
        this will be immediately loaded (this operation is very fast even for
        substantial amounts of data).

        If you want to refresh the data contained in the model (which you typically
        want to), call the :meth:`_refresh_data()` method.

        :param entity_type: Shotgun entity type to download
        :param filters:   List of Shotgun filters. Standard Shotgun syntax. Passing None instead of a list of
                          filters indicates that no shotgun data should be retrieved and no API calls will be made.
        :param hierarchy: List of grouping fields. These should be names of Shotgun
                          fields. If you for example want to create a list of items,
                          the value ``["code"]`` will be suitable. This will generate a data
                          model which is flat and where each item's default name is the
                          Shotgun name field. If you want to generate a tree where assets
                          are broken down by asset type, you could instead specify
                          ``["sg_asset_type", "code"]``.
        :param fields:    Fields to retrieve from Shotgun (in addition to the ones specified
                          in the hierarchy parameter). Standard Shotgun API syntax. If you
                          specify None for this parameter, Shotgun will not be called when
                          the _refresh_data() method is being executed.
        :param order:     Order clause for the Shotgun data. Standard Shotgun API syntax.
                          Note that this is an advanced parameter which is meant to be used
                          in subclassing only. The model itself will be ordered by its
                          default display name, and if any other type of ordering is desirable,
                          use for example a QProxyModel to handle this. However, knowing in which
                          order results will arrive from Shotgun can be beneficial if you are doing
                          grouping, deferred loading and aggregation of data as part of your
                          subclassed implementation, typically via the :meth:`_before_data_processing()` method.
        :param seed:      Advanced parameter. With each shotgun query being cached on disk, the model
                          generates a cache seed which it is using to store data on disk. Since the cache
                          data on disk is a reflection of a particular shotgun query, this seed is typically
                          generated from the various query and field parameters passed to this method. However,
                          in some cases when you are doing advanced subclassing, for example when you are culling
                          out data based on some external state, the model state does not solely depend on the
                          shotgun query parameters. It may also depend on some external factors. In this case,
                          the cache seed should also be influenced by those parameters and you can pass
                          an external string via this parameter which will be added to the seed.
        :param limit:     Limit the number of results returned from Shotgun. In conjunction with the order
                          parameter, this can be used to effectively cap the data set that the model
                          is handling, allowing a user to for example show the twenty most recent notes or
                          similar.

        This method is called before the item is added into the model tree. At the point when

        models that a new item has been added. This methods allows a subclassing object to

        .. note:: When an item is fetched from the cache, this method is *not* called, it will

        Called whenever an item is constructed and needs to be associated with a default thumbnail.

        the model data, meaning that this method is executed each time an item is constructed,
        regardless of if it came from an asynchronous shotgun query or a cache fetch.

        The purpose of this method is that you can subclass it if you want to ensure that items
        have an associated thumbnail directly when they are first created.

        Later on in the data load cycle, if the model was instantiated with the
        `download_thumbs` parameter set to True,
        the standard Shotgun ``image`` field thumbnail will be automatically downloaded for all items (or

          from a payload coming from the Shotgun API.
        - After the item has been set up with its associated Shotgun data,

        instantiated with the download_thumbs flag set to be true. It will be called for
