def sanitize_for_qt_model(val):
    """
    Useful when you have shotgun (or other) data and want to 
    prepare it for storage as role data in a model.

    Qt/pyside/pyqt automatically changes the data to be unicode
    according to internal rules of its own, sometimes resulting in 
    unicode errors. A safe strategy for storing unicode data inside
    Qt model roles is therefore to ensure everything is converted to
    unicode prior to insertion into the model. This method ensures 
    that. All string values will be coonverted to unicode. UTF-8
    is assumed for all strings: 

    in:  {"a":"aaa", "b": 123, "c": {"x":"y", "z":"aa"}, "d": [ {"x":"y", "z":"aa"} ] }
    out: {'a': u'aaa', 'c': {'x': u'y', 'z': u'aa'}, 'b': 123, 'd': [{'x': u'y', 'z': u'aa'}]}

    This method is the counterpart to sanitize_qt() which is the reciprocal
    of this operation. When working with Qt models and shotgun data,
    we recommend the following best practices:

    - when sg data is inserted into a role in model, run it through
      sanitize_for_qt_model() first
    - When taking it back out again, run it through sanitize_qt()
