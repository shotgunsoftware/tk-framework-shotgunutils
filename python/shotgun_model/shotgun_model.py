    A Qt Model representing a Shotgun query.

    This class implements a standard :class:`~PySide.QtCore.QAbstractItemModel`
    specialized to hold the contents of a particular Shotgun query. It is cached
    and refreshes its data asynchronously.

    In order to use this class, you normally subclass it and implement certain key data
    methods for setting up queries, customizing etc. Then you connect your class to
    a :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QAbstractItemView` of some sort which will display the result.
    If you need to do manipulations such as sorting or filtering on the data,
    connect a proxy model (typically :class:`~PySide.QtGui.QSortFilterProxyModel`)
    between your class and the view.

                                          of a list of filters indicates that no shotgun data should be retrieved
                                          and no API calls will be made.
        :param hierarchy:                 List of grouping fields. These should be names of Shotgun
                                          fields. If you for example want to create a list of items,
                                          the value ``["code"]`` will be suitable. This will generate a data
                                          model which is flat and where each item's default name is the
                                          Shotgun name field. If you want to generate a tree where assets
                                          are broken down by asset type, you could instead specify
                                          ``["sg_asset_type", "code"]``.
        :param fields:                    Fields to retrieve from Shotgun (in addition to the ones specified
                                          in the hierarchy parameter). Standard Shotgun API syntax. If you
                                          specify None for this parameter, Shotgun will not be called when
                                          the _refresh_data() method is being executed.
        :param order:                     Order clause for the Shotgun data. Standard Shotgun API syntax.
                                          Note that this is an advanced parameter which is meant to be used
                                          in subclassing only. The model itself will be ordered by its
                                          default display name, and if any other type of ordering is desirable,
                                          use for example a QProxyModel to handle this. However, knowing in which
                                          order results will arrive from Shotgun can be beneficial if you are doing
                                          grouping, deferred loading and aggregation of data as part of your
                                          subclassed implementation, typically via the :meth:`_before_data_processing()` method.
        :param seed:                      Advanced parameter. With each shotgun query being cached on disk, the model
                                          generates a cache seed which it is using to store data on disk. Since the cache
                                          data on disk is a reflection of a particular shotgun query, this seed is typically
                                          generated from the various query and field parameters passed to this method. However,
                                          in some cases when you are doing advanced subclassing, for example when you are culling
                                          out data based on some external state, the model state does not solely depend on the
                                          shotgun query parameters. It may also depend on some external factors. In this case,
                                          the cache seed should also be influenced by those parameters and you can pass
                                          an external string via this parameter which will be added to the seed.
        :param limit:                     Limit the number of results returned from Shotgun. In conjunction with the order
                                          parameter, this can be used to effectively cap the data set that the model
                                          is handling, allowing a user to for example show the twenty most recent notes or
                                          similar.
        :param list columns:              If columns is specified, then any leaf row in the model will have columns created where
                                          each column in the row contains the value for the corresponding field from columns. This means
                                          that the data from the loaded entity will be available field by field. Subclasses can modify
                                          this behavior by overriding _get_additional_columns.
        :param additional_filter_presets: List of Shotgun filter presets to apply, e.g.
                                          ``[{"preset_name":"LATEST","latest_by":"BY_PIPELINE_STEP_NUMBER_AND_ENTITIES_CREATED_AT"}]``
        :param list editable_columns:     A subset of ``columns`` that will be editable in views that use this model.
