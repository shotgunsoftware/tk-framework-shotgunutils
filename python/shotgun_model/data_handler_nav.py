        :param str root_path: The path to the root of the hierarchy to display.
            This corresponds to the ``path`` argument of the
            :meth:`~shotgun-api3:shotgun_api3.Shotgun.nav_expand()`
            api method. For example, ``/Project/65`` would correspond to a
            project on you shotgun site with id of ``65``.

        :param str seed_entity_field: This is a string that corresponds to the
            field on an entity used to seed the hierarchy. For example, a value
            of ``Version.entity`` would cause the model to display a hierarchy
            where the leaves match the entity value of Version entities.

        :param dict entity_fields: A dictionary that identifies what fields to
            include on returned entities. Since the hierarchy can include any
            entity structure, this argument allows for specification of
            additional fields to include as these entities are returned. The
            dict's keys correspond to the entity type and the value is a list
            of field names to return.

        :param str cache_path: Path to cache file location.

        :param str include_root: Defines the name of an additional, top-level
            model item that represents the root. In views, this item will appear
            as a sibling to top-level children of the root. This allows for
            UX whereby a user can select an item representing the root without
            having a UI that shows a single, top-level item. An example would
            be displaying published file entity hierarchy with top level items:
            "Assets", "Shots", and "Project Publishes". In this example, the
            supplied arg would look like: ``include_root="Project Publishes"``.
            If ``include_root`` is ``None``, no root item will be added.
